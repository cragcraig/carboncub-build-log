Cut out MDF firewall stiffener board (shop aid) and fastened to firewall with 4 x 7/16 bolts through engine mount holes.

Attached 4 aluminum angles and match drilled holes with #30 bit. Ensured firewall was flat to stiffener with spring clamps. Very minor filing in a few spots around the end of the firewall to help the angle pieces fit nicely. Deburred all holes and clekoed in place.
