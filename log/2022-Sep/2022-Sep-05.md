Trimmed rear tab on #2 rib leading edge rib to be flush with the top of the front cutout in the top of #2 false rib.

Installed cherrymax rivet in rear spar reinforcement cap where it conflicts with the top #7 center rib SS42 rivet. It only conflicted slightly on this wing so then pulling the SS42 rivet to attach the center rib was not an issue.

Rear spar pulley bracket was already clekoed in place with a match drilled #40 hole. Matched drilled the remaining 4 #30 holes from the bracket through the reinforcement cap and spar cap, drilled out the #40 indexing hole to #30, deburred all holes, and installed cherrymax rivets.

Applied methacrylate adhesive to bottom mating surfaces of #2 trailing edge rib, then quickly pulled cherrymax rivets through the predrilled side holes. Then repeated this steps to attach the #2 false rib to the leading edge rib. Due to cleareance issue with #2.5 leading edge rib the pneumatic pulled could not be used even with the offset puller head to pull the front two rivets on the leading edge rib, so used the cherry hand puller to pull those.
