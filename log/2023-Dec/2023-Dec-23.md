Pulled blind stainless steel rivets AD32BS in matched holes along overlapping edges of baggage area panels (bottom, rear, left, right).

This required some awkward positions with the fuselage rotated upside-down so I could kneel inside the baggage compartment area.

Managed to then with some finangling of the sheet metal get the carbon fiber baggage door out of its position, which I
incorrectly temporarily put in place with the sheet metal on the inside of the bottom edge of the carbon fiber frame. It will also
be easier to install the twist-lock receptables and door hinge on the bench prior to fitting the door assembly in place.

Re-orient the two halves of the door hinge properly relative to each other (facing opposing directions) and clamped it in place on
the carbon fiber baggage door panel. Lightly filed down the corners to fit the hinge nicely in the indent in the panel. Clamped in
position and then match drilled hinge to door panel with #40 bit. Squeezed AN426A3-5 rivets with SS backing washers to fix hinge in
position. Kit was short 1 rivet, so left a hole on the end empty for now that will be easy to come back and reach with the squeezer
even after the door and panel are installed.
