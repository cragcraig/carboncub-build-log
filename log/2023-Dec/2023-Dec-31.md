Touched up minor scratches in fuselage's power coat with Rustoleum satin black enamel. These were from a variety of sources, including from the factory/shipping, scuffs from installing the floorboard, and scrapes from the corners of the baggage area sheet metal panels.

Prepped outside of baggage panels for methacrylate by lightly scuffing fuselage tubes and panels then cleaning surfaces with denatured alcohol.

Applied methacrylate between outer surfaces of baggage panels and fuselage tubes and baggage door frame as appropriate. Clamped in place with spring clamps as needed.
