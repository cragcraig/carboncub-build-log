Marked locations for 3 twist-lock receptacles, drilling first the center with 0.25", then one side
of the receptacle with #30, cleko, then match drill the other side. Check how centered the hole actually was,
then drill out to 3/8", correcting if needed to improve the centered-ness of the center hole.

Countersunk the #30 holes (front side of the door frame) and squeezed 2x soft AN426A4-6 rivets to fasten each receptacle.

Fit the door into the frame and clamped the hinge in place on the frame. Match drilled the two end holes into the frame
with #27 bit, clekoed in place, match drilled the center hole, clekoed, then match drilled the remaining 2 holes. Installed
6-32 SS machine screws in these holes with lock nuts and verified proper fit of the door in the frame.

Re-placed the door frame in position in the fuselage against the sheet metal panels.
