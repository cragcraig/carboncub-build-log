After a while of not working on the plane due to unexpected & expected life things (kate's mom passed, baby shower & parents in town) and some slight avoidance of having to debug the fuel system, I did some research on the forums which turned up an interesting approach of using a balloon to pressurize the system instead of the air compressor. One then simply monitors for change in the balloon overnight to check for leaks.

I attached a balloon in the morning (attached with lots of tight electrical tape and inflated by blowing through the AN bolt-plugged end of the fuel line. The balloon sadly lost a little bit of air by the evening and was even worse the next morning. It continued to steadily lose air throughout the week.
