After a while of not working on the plane due to unexpected & expected life things (kate's mom passed, baby shower & parents in town) and slightly avoiding having to debug the fuel system, I did some research on the forums which turned up an interesting approach of using a balloon in place of the air compressor to pressurize the system. One then simply monitors the balloon overnight to check for leaks.

I attached a balloon in the morning (attached with lots of tight electrical tape and inflated through the AN bolt plugged end of the fuel line. The balloon sadly lost a little bit of air by the evening and was even worse the next morning. It steadily lost air throughout the week.
