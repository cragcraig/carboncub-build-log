## Adjusted rudder stops

Ground down rudder stops using die grinder until distance from front of fin to front of rudder was just under 7" for full deflection on both sides.

## Jack screw

Began jack screw installation by assembling spring to end of bungee cable assembly.
Removed powder coat overspray from inside of the top fuselage tube so jack screw spins easily.
Installed screw through pre-assembled jack screw yoke assembly and fuselage tubes with appropriate hardware. Used some lithium grease as made sense with the jack screw and moving parts (e.g., pulley).
Formed metal strap around yoke and attached bungee cable. Tighted so movement is minimal but bungee cable end is able to rotate without resistance.

## Fuel system, testing cont

Got some parts in, so continuing the fuel system testing.

I suspect/hope the leak may not be any of my fuel line fittings but rather just the loosely hand-installed rear low point fuel drain. I reinstalled it with loctite 567 thread sealant (which according to the forum is what the factory uses now for aluminum fuel fittings, despite what the manual says) and after letting that set for a while I replaced the balloon with a newly acquired fresh balloon and let the test go.

Aaand... balloon still looks good the next morning! Let's see how it does over a few more days.

Update: Balloon stayed good all week!!! I'm ready to call the fuel system officially sealed and verified as far as I can tell.
