## Adjusted rudder stops

Ground down rudder stops using die grinder until distance from front of fin to front of rudder was just under 7" for full deflection on both sides.

## Jack screw

Began jack screw installation by assembling spring to end of bungee cable assembly.
Removed powder coat overspray from inside of the top fuselage tube so jack screw spins easily.
Installed screw through pre-assembled jack screw yoke assembly and fuselage tubes with appropriate hardware. Used some lithium grease as made sense with the jack screw and moving parts (e.g., pulley).
Formed metal strap around yoke and attached bungee cable. Tighted so movement is minimal but bungee cable end is able to rotate without resistance.
