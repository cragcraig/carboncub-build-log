Did a risky/tricky drill job to drill a #40 hole through the methacrylate between the left baggage panel and the fuselage tube so that I could attach the fuel tube there with a zip tie. Turned out well -- but next time, save the stress by just leaving a gap when applying the methacrylate.

Added a bunch more reinforced attachment points in between existing ones and added additional zip tie stand-offs to really hold the fuel lines solidly. Zip tied fule lines up the tubes along the sides of the windshield, down the right side of the baggage area through the stringer and around the back corner, and played around with a few ways of installing stand-offs from the left stringer where the line goes around the back left corner. Zip tied to holes drilled in the left stringer and routed through the stringer, being careful to ensure it maintains a consistently downward slope with no low points for contaminants to get stuck.
