Swapped out the pressure regulator on my compressed air line with a better, more precise regulator that I picked up at McGuckin Hardware so that I could trust it to limit at less than 15 PSI for testing the fuel lines -- I aimed for a couple PSI under 10 PSI.

Tighted fuel line fittings about 1.5-2 turns past finger tight (marked with sharpie to track start position). Tightened aluminum fittings 2.5 turns, or until they bottomed out (IIRC just one bottomed out).

- Assembled a little test fitting for attaching the fuel lines to the air compressor using 3/8" automotive tubing. 
- Attached fuel lines together on each side where they will eventually go into the fuel tank using 2 pieces of automotive tubing.
- Plugged the open line for the front fuel low point drain using a piece of automotive tubing with a 3/8" AN bolt stuck in the end.

Mixed up a squirt bottle of ~15:1 water and dish washing liquid to use to detect leaking air from fittings.
