Testing used a magnifying glass (I believe 3x and 6x), flashlight, and the mixed soapy water.

After verifying that the fuel selector was correct by checking that air could come out of each fuel tank line, I started by testing the aluminum fittings at the fuel selector which all checked out bubble free.

However, as soon as I started checking the nylon fittings (starting just aft of the fuel selector) I found a small amount of leakage. I discovered that this was likely due to not wiping down the end of the fuel line with denatured alcohol before assembling the fitting. After doing so and reassembling the fitting, no leaks were found despite a LOT of double checking and soapy water. Cleaned off fitting with alcohol to remove soapy water. Since this repeated on each of the 3 lines in this fitting, for all the other fittings I didn't even bother to check before disassembling, cleaning with denatured alcohol, and reassembling. This worked well and all other fittings came out leak free after the reassembly.

I assembled a test fitting where I could disconnect from my compressed air system using a ball valve and monitor the pressure with an air pressure gauge as part of the fitting. However, the 8 PSI would still leak out over 30 seconds or so.
