1. Match drilled double ribs #3 and #5 into front and aft spars
1. Checked that drill holes avoided spar cap bulbs and deburred
1. Riveted center ribs #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #10, #11, #12 to front and rear spars using modified marson hand puller

Note: Had many failed pulls that had to be drilled out in the first couple of ribs, but then no issues once Kate was home and helped push against spar and held flashlight + reground modified surface of rivet puller against head to be at less of an angle.

Skipped ribs #8 and #9 (left them clekoed) as they are close to the lift strut fittings and will need clearance to rivet to front and training edge ribs. They will be be installed later. Also waiting for replacement #1 rib to arrive from CubCrafters as the original halfs of the double rib were different heights.
