Reamed all AN4 and AN5 bolt holes with Zach's assistance to ensure I was pulling the reamer through as straight as possible. Most holes were reamed with a 1 thou undersized reamer, though some of the AN4 holes required a second pass or a pass with the .250" reamer. All bolts were very nicely snug, either barely able to be inserted by hand or requiring some light tapping and silicone grease. Lock nuts were snugged but not yet torqued.
