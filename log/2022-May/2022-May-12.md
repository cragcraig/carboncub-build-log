## Morning
Squared and taped leading edge ribs in preparation for moving left wing into wing holder!!!

TIP: Next time just run the tape down tight first without squaring the ribs, then go along adjusting the ribs to square.

## Evening
New combined EX2 & EX3 manual indicated to install universal head side rivets at attachment point between trailing edge ribs and center ribs (top and bottom). Rivets were not included in EX2 kit but arrived from Aircraft Spruce this afternoon.

Drilled #40 and squeezed rivets top and bottom in all single ribs. This would have been easier to do earlier as some of the trailing edge ribs that do not attach to a center rib were in the way of the squeezer for the top of rib #7 and #8. Had to slightly trim a rib (which the updated manual suggested doing prior to installing the unattached ribs anyway) to fit the squeezer mostly straight. The bottom #8 rib was very difficult due to clearance issues with struct fitting & drag tube assembly. Was able to barely drill using the offset drill head and then just managed to get the ground down squeezer head in enough to squeeze at a barely-acceptable angle.
