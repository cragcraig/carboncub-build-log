## #5 Rib fabric rivet holes
* Drilled #30 fabric rivet hole in center of rib #5 bottom rib clip.
* Match drilled top fabric holes in inboard side of #5 double center rib using 12" bit from below the rib.

## Fuel tank skin extension
1. Match drilled and clekoed #30 rivet holes 5/8" from rear edge of skin extension through the corresponding 3 trailing edge ribs.
  * Taped front lip in place flush against forward-side of rear spar cap while drilling to ensure correct fit in next step.
1. Measured, marked, matched drilled, and clekoed tank skin extension to side of rear spar cap.
  * Used Avery drill jig to ensure hole did not hit the spar cap bulb (*phew*).
    It was rather awkward fitting it against/under the fuel straps and required a lot of pushng to ensure it stayed in place against the spar cap.
    Would recommend a second person to hold the jig next time.
  * Very awkward getting at this with all the fuel straps -- required lots of creative access (standing on sawhorse, kneeling underneath, leaning across).
    Used both normal air drill and 90 deg drill head.
