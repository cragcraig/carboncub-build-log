Cleaned and inspected both spars.

Installed wing root fitting and lift strut fitting on front spar with Zach's assistance.
Reamed using slightly undersized reamers, about half of the bolts were able to be lightly tapped into place with some lithium grease after a single reamer pass while another half required a second pass.
All holes ended up very straight and with a nice snug fit on the bolts.
