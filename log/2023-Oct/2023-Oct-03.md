Disassembled front torque tube block and adjusted shim so that it rotated smoothly with the floorboard in its final position, then re-installed bolts and torqued to 90 in*lb.

Fully installed most floorboard machine screws with blue loctite threadlocker (except for the screws around the rudder pedals) and torqued to 22 in*lb.

One in the rear area (to the immediate left of the pulley cover) is giving me trouble and was stripping at 22 in*lb.
