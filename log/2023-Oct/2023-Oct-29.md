Tried 0.007, 0.013, and 0.016 inch shims between rear torque tube block halves. Larger was better. Still a little more resistance on the controls than ideal, may want to increase to 0.020 and/or add small shim (0.005?) between front torque tube block halves.

Torqued rear torque tube block bolts to 90 in lb.

## Installed aileron control stop plate.

1. Ensured fuselage was level using electronic level.
1. Ensured torque tube control mast was vertical using electronic level.
1. Centered stop plate on either side of torque tube mast (3/8" on each side) with 1/8" clearance from rear of mast and taped in place.
1. Match drilled 6 holes through plate to floorboard with #10. Needed to use offset drill for one.
1. Installed 6 machine screws through plate and floorboard and torqued lock nuts to 31 in lb.

## Pre-drill holes in floorboard

Used #10 hole finder to match drill 5 holes along rear edge of floorboard to match the pre-tapped holes in the fuselage. These will later be match drilled to the front backage floor aluminum sheet piece and then enlarged to #5, but best to leave as #10 and enlarge both together later.

Used #40 drill bushing with 1/4" OD to drill a #40 pilot hole up through floorboard through pre-tapped locking holes in fuselage for attaching front seat belt.
Followed with a #30 being careful to not drill against the tapped sides of the hole.
Made a small piece of sheet steel to protect against drilling into the holes and inserted it between the floorboard and fuselage.
Drilled out pilot holes through floorboard from top with 5/16" bit.

## Rudder springs

Cleaned off diagonal fuselage tubes in front of front rudder pedals with alcohol then attached a wrap of friction tape around tube at the bottom where it is welded to other tubes.
Installed spring into pre-drilled hole in back of rudder pedal, then bent end of springs slightly so they can't fall out.
Installed clamp around tube over friction tape with other end of springs between clamp flanges (bolt goes through the end of the spring). Bent end of springs slightly so they can't slip off the bolt.
Adjusted angle of clamp flanges/spring position to what seemed most ideal to avoid awkward bending of the springs and mirrored on both sides to extend possible by eye.
Tighened bolts to 31 in lb. Required some creativity to hold bolt head with another wrench while tightening due to tight space between pedals and fuselage tubes.
