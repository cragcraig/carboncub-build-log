Installed machine screws in front rudder pedals and through stiffener. Match drilled final holes through stiffener and torqued all screws to 22 in*lb.

Match drilled remaining holes in rear rudder pedal base to floorboard and loosely fit screws. Washers are too large to sit flat (the edges catch on the CNC curve of the pedal base sides. Used dremel to sand down the area of the pedal base where the washers need to sit so they can lay flat. Unfortunately stripped the AN-5A threads in the process of checking this multiple times, so cleaned out the threads with a tap and ordered replacement AN-5A bolts from Aircraft Spruce.

Was able to clean out the threads for the screw in the rear part of the floorboard that was previously giving me trouble (used a #10-32 tap) and was able to install a new screw torqued to 20 in*lb.
