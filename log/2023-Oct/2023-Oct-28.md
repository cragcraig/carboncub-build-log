Torqued castle nuts to 20 in lb and installed cotter pins on bolts attaching brake connection to rear pedals.

1. Lightly sanded the torque tube where it goes through the block with 120 grit emery cloth, followed by 300 grit sandpaper.
1. Lubricated the torque tube with lithium grease.
1. Identified aligned location for rear torque tube block by feeling where control rotation resistance is minimal.
1. Match drilled holes from torque tube block to fuselage floorboard.
1. Temporarily installed bolts just to snug with torque tube stiffener in place.
1. Match drilled #10 holes from torque tube stiffener to floorboard center seat column.
1. Installed machine screws to fix torque tube stiffener to floorboard and torqued to 40 in lb.

The torque tube moves smoothly in the blocks until the rear torque tube blocks are fully tightened down.
Added .016" shim aluminum under the blocks to match the front. This helped but was not enough, it seems adding around .01" shim between the blocks is necessary to allow smooth movement. Looking into acquiring some shim stock.
