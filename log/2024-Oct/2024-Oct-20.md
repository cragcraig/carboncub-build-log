Aligned CC363-FP firewall paper template under the firewall using edges and prexisting holes to align as best as possible (within about 3/32" for the farthest out holes). It's not perfect since the printed scale does not perfectly match the predrilled holes in the firewall, which is why I will use the actual parts as templates spacing when drilling the holes for each. Cut out the template around the edge of the firewall, then moved it on top and used a center punch to mark the center of 1 hole for each component.
