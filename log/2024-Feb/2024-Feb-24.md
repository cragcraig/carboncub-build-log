Loosely placed fuel line fittings and trimmed fuel line sections to more exact lengths now that the fittings were in place.

Identified attachment points where the fuel lines will be zip tied to the fuselage tubes and assembled a reinforcement consisting of a ~1" long piece of larger diameter nylon tube over the fuel line tube, held in place with wraps of friction tape overlapping either end. The zip tie goes around the fuel lines at these reinforced points.
