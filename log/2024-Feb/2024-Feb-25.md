Cut chafe protection into sections matching where it needs to be installed over the fuel lines. Installed chafe protection, zip tying fuel line to fuselage tube at each reinforced point as I went.

Where the left side fuel line wraps around the back of the baggage compartment required a few tries before I was happy with the position and angle. Unfortunately I did not leave a gap in the right place when methacrylating the baggage compartment left side panel to the fuselage tube where I would like to be able to zip tie the fuel line.
