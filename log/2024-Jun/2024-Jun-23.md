New coupler arrived from CubCrafters and visually was clearly much better centered. Apparently this is a lathe part, so it's not clear how the first one was improperly fabricated.

I also realized from looking on the cubcrafters forum that the Executive Glass Panel pre-cover kit includes a trim sensor that should be installed as part of this step. Riveted sensor to sensor bracket with 2 countersunk solid AD rivets.

Also I wasn't happy with how easily the jack screw rotated, so I removed the jack screw and wrapped 150 grit emery cloth around a large drill bit. I also had to remove the rudder and tail fin (which were only loosely installed) to clear access for the drill. I then used the low rpm drill to lightly sand the inside of the fuselage tube that holds the jack screw. I also lightly sanded the smaller tube that holds the other end of the jack screw, though this one is short and hard to reach with a drill so was sanded by hand. After reinstalling the jack screw and thrust bushing it rotated much more easily (still without any wiggle).

Disassembled motor mount and swapped in the new coupler. The trim sensor bracket is held to the motor mount using 2 of the same AN bolts that hold the motor in place, so added the trim sensor and reassembled the motor mount.

Reinstalled the roll pins and test-bolted motor in place. Attached 12V power supply and tested the motor through its range of travel -- seems like the problem was indeed the bad coupler as everything now rotates fairly smoothly with only very minor variation throughout the shaft rotation.

Completed the motor install by applying red loctite to motor mount bolts (except used blue loctite on the bolt holding the wire harness clamp. From the forum it seems like on the EX3 they may have updated the manual to use blue loctite on all these bolts. Oh well, I'm sure I will be able to remove them someday if needed.

Fixed both roll pins in place in the coupler using 0.032" safety wire.

Adjusted the wire harnesses and zip ties a bit to incorporate the new trim sensor harness and routed alongside the existing motor harness up the left stringer and through the boot cowl spacer.
