Missing hardware arrived from CubCrafters so I was able to finish attaching the trim sensor to the trim yoke assembly.

I wasn't happy with how the wire harnesses were supported so I ended up cutting off all the zip ties and redoing them so that the trim sensor harness is better incorporated.

Prepped the top fuselage stringer by sanding down where it attaches to the tail fin until it could slip over the fin and sat as flush as possible. This involved a bit of initial trimming with a cutoff wheel on the die grinder followed by a huge number of test fit iterations with round and flat files to remove additional carbon fiber material.
