Removed more powder coat from top trim jack screw tube and installed jack screw with yoke in place with thrust bushing. Match drilled thrust bushing with #12 bit (changed from F in previous version of the manual). Short a AN3-12A screw. Managed to pinch thumb between jack screw and top tube, took a big chunk out which required bandaging and reduced ability to make much progress today.

Installed top and bottom limit screws for jack screw yoke limit switches and top and bottom limit screws for elevator.
