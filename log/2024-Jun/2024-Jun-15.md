Attempted to finish the trim motor installation.

* Adjusted the limit switch stop screws so that they trigger the limit switches with roughtly 1/16 margin of travel left from top/bottom on the jack screw.
* Temporarily installed motor to mount (no loctite on screws) with coupler in place
* Match drilled coupler to jack screw shaft (#30)
* Match drilled coupler to motor shaft at ~90 degrees to flat side of motor shaft (#30)
* Inserted 2 roll pins and fastened in place with 0.032" safety wire

However, when I attached a 12V power supply and tested the motor travel, the motor slowed significantly for part of each rotation and caused the sheet metal mount welded to the fuselage to flex then unflex by a concerning amount. After some investigation it seems that the jack screw coupler was fabricated inproperly at the factory. The coupler appears to be a piece of 0.5" (mild?) steel rod drilled out at different diameter holes from each end (one end the hole is diameter of the jack screw, the other end hole is the diameter of the motor shaft). These holes should have been drilled along a common center rotational axis, but were in fact offset by roughtly 0.015" which could be easily seen visually just looking down the hole. This was forcing the spacing between the motor and the shaft to change throughout the shaft rotation.

I've requested a replacement coupler from CubCrafters.

Cleaned up and organized the routing of the wire harness around the motor mount and limit switches using some additional small zip ties so that the limit switch wires all move cleanly as a bundle through the travel of the limit switches on the yoke.
