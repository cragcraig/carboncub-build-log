1. Match drilled row of 5 x #10 holes at rear edge of floor plate into front aluminum sheet floor panel for baggage area / passenger area using hole finder.
1. Removed panel and enlarged holes to #5, deburred.
1. Refit panel, identified 2 holes that needed slight additional expansion for everything to fit nicely, removed panel and enlarged with hand file.
1. Put panel in place, match drilled 2 x 0.25" holes from fuselage to alumnium floor panel for passenger seat belt bolts.
1. Removed panel and enlarged these holes to 5/16"; deburred.
1. Placed panel in plane, installed 5 machine screws through the #5 hole to attached both panels to pre-tapped holes in the fuselage tube; used blue loctite threadlocker on screws. Torqued to 22 in-lb.
1. Also installed final 2 machine screws in the floor panel that had been skipped when installing all the other floor board screws previously so that the rear end of the primary carbon fiber floor board panel could still be pulled up slightly from the fuselage tube while performing this step.

Placed 15 lb weights in both of the rear baggage areas to ensure the baggage floor panels are held in their final positions against the floor fuselage tubes when the panels match drilled and riveted together in the next step.
