Installed rudder cable fairlead brackets ~28 inches forward of baggage rear panel fairleads, avoiding hitting the fuselage tubes with the rivet holes.

This required first threading the rudder cable through the various fuselage fairleads and attaching the rudder control cables to the rudder pedals.
Alex then helped out and pulled the rudder cables tight to identify the best vertical placement for the fairlead brackets. The left bracket was difficult to place since it required a tradeoff between avoiding redirecting the cable while also not allowing the cable to rub against a diagonal fuselage tube that crosses through the fuselage just in front of the baggage compartment. Endeded up trying 3 positions, but was able to space the rivet holes sufficiently that there is no concern about spacing from the unused holes. The bracket also covers all but 1 unused hole, so resulted in minimal visual blemish.

Frustratingly, running the control cable required removing the rear baggage panel fairleads, which were a huge pain to install the snap rings on.
