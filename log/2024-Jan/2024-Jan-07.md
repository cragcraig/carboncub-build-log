## Riveted front and rear baggage area floor panels together

1. Match drilled 7x #40 holes at the overlap of the front and rear baggage floor panels.
1. Deburred holes
1. Pulled HDW-AD32BS blind rivets

## Baggage door fasteners

Match drilled 3 x 0.25" holes in the baggage door by drilled through the recepticles installed on the baggage door frame. This was awkward to do with the frame installed and didn't result in perfectly centered holes, so I measured carefully to identify where the boundaries of the enlarged 5/16" hole should be and expaned the 0.25" pilot holes to be centered in that area, then expanded the holes with a 5/16" bit. The holes then lined up nicely (the recepticles allow for reasonable margin in the alignment anyway).

Test fitting the 3 fasteners in the door worked very nicely and I'm pleased with how the door turned out.

## Methacrylate

1. Lightly scuffed sheet aluminum and fuselage tube powder coat in areas to be bonded
1. With weights still sitting on the front and rear baggage floor panels to hold them down, applied methacrylate:
   1. Between the fuselage cross tubes and panels on the bottom of the fuselage
   1. Between along both the sides of the front floor panel and forward-to-rear fuselage tubes
   1. Touched up a few areas around the baggage door frame where the existing methacrylate coverage wasn't sufficient to hold the aluminum side panel fixed against the door frame.
   1. Baggage door frame aluminum extensions into postition against the baggage door frame
