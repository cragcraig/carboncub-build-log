## Outer rib clip

Finished drilling holes for the outer rib clip into the machined aileron hanger and center rib. Installed cherrymax rivets in machined rib. Out of CR3213-4-2 for the center rib so waiting for those to arrive before fully completing. Used 0.200" margin for clips on this wing which worked out well (and is greater than 1.5 * 0.1285" = 0.1927").

## Nose rib prep

Trimmed and sanded all nose ribs per manual diagrams using: tin snips, hand nibbler, emory cloth, small file, a fine hobby sanding stick, and a dremel with a sanding attachment.

## Completed rear spar reinforcement

With Zach's help: matched drilled remaining holes between clekoes on rear spar reinforcement. Deburred holes and pulled cherrymax CR3213-4-4 rivets. Countersunk hole #24 and pulled countersunk cherrymax as it will be underneath the pulley bracket.

Match drilled hole #23 with a #40 bit so that it can be used to align the pulley bracket with a cleko.
