* Trimmed trailing edge ribs that attach to double center ribs
* Trimmed top of #2 trailing edge ribs to not extend in past the spar cap
* Clekoed all tail ribs in place and most leading edge ribs (until I ran out of clekos)
* Needed to remove small amount of material from top tab of 1 trailing edge rib to create necessary clearance from cherrymax head on reinforcement spar cap.

Also used dremel with small sanding drum to remove small amounts of material to create clearance on rear spar aileron pulley bracker from reinforcement spar cap rivets #22 and #25.
