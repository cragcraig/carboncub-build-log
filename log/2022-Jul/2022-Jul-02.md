Zach came over and helped with these again as it is critical to drill and pull these straight so as to not have any unnecessary issues. It is a pain to deal with mispulled cherrymax rivets in the spar cap where removing them risks damaging the spar cap bulbs.

## Front Spar Aileron Pulley Bracket

I fabricated a steel shield (1.25" x 1.5") using 22 gauge steel sheet. I made a ~45 degree bend ~0.25" down from one edge then tack welded on a 0.25" bolt on the other end as a handle.
This shield was able to slip inside the spar cap between the cherrymax tail and the spar bulb to provide protection to the bulb and a surface to bend the tail of the rivet as it was punched out.

We then used my dremel cutting wheel jig that I fabricated for removing similar mispulled rivets on Zach's wings to cut into the rivet tail. This could not remove the portion under the bulb, but was able to remove about one half the of tail steel stem cap.

We then drilled off the head of the cherrymax with a rivet removal tool.

We then lightly tapped the stem out using a small pin punch while protecting the spar bulb with the steel shield. This worked very well -- the steel shield did not deform at all, unlike the aluminum sheet metal shields we had tried previously on Zach's wings.

Once the steel stem was out it was a simple matter to punch out the aluminum sheath with a 1/8" pin punch while protecting the spar bulb with the steel shield. The aluminum sheath deformed easily against the steel shield.

The rivet hole diameter seemed to be well within allowable range, so we gave it a quick additional run with a #30 bit to enlarge the hole slightly and clean up the edges from the removal. The bottom was fairly well deburred (as these under spar cap holes go) with only a slight lip, but we cleaned that up more as well just to be extra careful.

We then tried pulling a new rivet and it pulled nicely.

## Rear Spar Reinforcement Strip

I had previously clamped the rear spar pulley bracket in place on the reinforcement strip. We put a string through the pulley and aligned the strip so that the string pulls dead center down the center aileron hanger.

We then centered the reinforcement strip (equal margin front and aft) over the spar cap and clamped in place with 8 clamps.

I match drilled every 4th predrilled hole in the reinforcment strip into the spar cap and cleko'd in place. Zach helped ensure the drill was straight for each drilling.

By stopping and cleaning off the drill bit once during each hole I was able to get clean exits to my holes with nearly no deburring needed. This was nice because deburring under the spar cap is hard.

## Loctite drag wire jam nuts

I applied red threadlocker under the outer nut in each jam nut pair except the innermost pair on each spar as those drag wires will need to be temporarily removed to install the fuel tanks later. I then applied torque seal to all jam nut pairs that I had threadlocked.
