Drilled, dimpled and installed solid rivets to center ribs with 0.25" margin from edges.

Drilled and installed bottom cherrymax to machined hanger. Messed up slightly by offsetting top center hole slightly to ensure clearance from inside of machined hanger wall, but forgot that needs to match the predrilled hole in the cap strip later. This is only drilled out to a #40 right now, so I will match drill from below through this hole in the machined hanger to make a slightly off-center hole in the cap strip, then cutting the countersink in the cap strip should consume the portion of the hole that was predrilled fully centered in the cap strip.
