Attached a string between bottom stringer endpoints on fuselage to indicate center for the fairlead blocks.

Fit the stringer and marked and trimmed (using angle grinder with abrasive cutoff wheel) a few inches to make the stringer tube the exact length between the endpoint fuselage tubes.

Trimmed the top of the -006 fuselage block due to the extra fuselage cross-tube in modren EX fuselages. Used a saw wheel on a dremel. Also needed to slightly enlarge the bottom half-circle cutout to fit the diameter of the stringer: expanded from ~0.45" to ~0.50" using a forstner bit on the drill press.

Used 150 grit emery cloth to lightly rough top and bottom cutouts on all blocks as well as the corresponding mating surfaces on fuselange tubes and stringer, then wiped all the surfaces down with denatured alcohol.

Applied methacrylate adhesive to the forward fuselage tube and forward inside of the stringer and inserted. Applied meth to the top cutouts on each block (from front to aft) and then held in place on the fuselage while the adhesive set using adjustable bungee cords across the bottom of the fuselage under each block location.

Applied an extra bead of meth on either side of the fuselage tube along the top of each block and formed a clean transion using finger & popsicle stick.

After this set for a couple hours so the blocks were fixed in position, applied meth to the bottom cutout of each block and held stringer in place while this set using the same bungee setup. Applied a small additonal bead of meth across the top where the two stringer tubes come together. Filled the aft gap between the string and fuselage cross brace with methacrylate (this essentially plays the role of a very short fairlead block for the rearmost fuselage crossing position of the stringer).

Throughout the process, frequently reconfirmed (and adjusted as necessary) the centering of the blocks using the string.
