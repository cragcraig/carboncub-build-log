Removed clamps, cleaned up extra methacrylate with denatured alcohol, and double checked top stringer placement.

Fixed aft end of top left stringer to fuselage tube with safety wire (drilled #50 holes through carbon fiber).

Trimmed the inner edge of the long left stringer so that it fits around the steel tube and allows the fabric spacer to fit flush on top of the stringer. Used an end mill in the die grinder to remove the carbon fiber. Protected the tube with a small piece of aluminum sheet.

Drilled a #10 hole in the top front of the lowest left stringer and zip tied it to the fuselage tube, pulling it in closer to the tube so that the fabric spacer sits smoothly without a bend/wrinkle.

Clamped the left fabric spacer in place flush to the boot cowl spacer and against the stringers, then marked where the bottom needs to be trimmed to fit around the landing gear attach bracket at the weld line.
