Trimmed the bottom of the left spacer to fit nicely around the landing gear attach bracked weld.

Adjusted left lower spacer's temporary zip tie to be flat with the boot cowl spacer. Drilled #10 hole and installed a temporary zip tie on the same spacer on the right side, but then realized it actually needed be pushed out instead of pulled in. Used a welding clamp to hold it out straight with the right boot cowl spacer.

Scuffed the edges of the fabric spacers, fuselage tubes, and stringers where the methacrylate will attach and then cleaned them with alcohol.

Methacrylated the end of each of the 2 bottom stringers (left & right) to the boot cowl spacers to permanently fix them in their current position (straight with the boot cowl spacer edge) where they are temporarily clamped/zip tied. Similarly applied methacrylate to fix the front end of the long left spacer to the fuselage tube.

Applied methacrylate to the top of the left fabric spacer and the outer edge of the boot cowl spacer and clamped it in place using a mix of spring clamps with wood blocks, cleko flat clamps, small ratcheting clamps, and tape.

Repeated this procedure to place the right fabric spacer.

Then applied a bead of methacrylate along the bottom inside edge of each fabric spacer to attach the bottom edge to the fuselage tube. Applied a similar bead on the inside of the right fabric spacer along the stringer. Per the manual, did NOT methacrylate the bottom left 2 stringers to the left fabric spacer.
