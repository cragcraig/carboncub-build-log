Swapped out bolt that holds thrust bushing on top of trim jack screw with an AN3-11A. The manual specified -12A but that required extra washers and sticks out so far it hits the stringer which prevents the stringer from sitting centered. Torqued to 38 in-lbs.

Reinstalled tail fin (bolts are loose, not torqued yet).

Trimmed the fronts of the stringer tabs that sit above the rear wall of the baggage compartment so that they sit nicely behind the compartment wall.

Prepped fuselage tube surfaces where stringer tabs will attach by roughing slighly and cleaning with alcohol.

Applied methacrylate adhesive to fuselage top and fin surface and clamped stringer aft end in place.

Repeated working my way up the stringer tabs from aft to front.

After finishing checked and realized that the stringer undulated badly side to side (the manual had lots of text about verifying that the stringer was level but never says anything that would imply that keeping the stringer straight between the centered end points would be an issue). This was an big problem because the methacrylate sets very quickly and the aftmost tabs has already set. I was able to disconnect the stringer tabs for all but the aftmost tabs (one on each side) and the two sets in front of those required a fair amount of force with a utility knife to cut through the partially cured methacrylate.

I then reapplied methacrylate, using a measuring tape at each set of tabs to ensure the stringer was centered. It was a bit of a rush and without being able to remove the partially cured, partially offset methacrylate from the first attempt it did not come out as clean as I'd like, but I did manage to salvage the stringer placement and I ended up happy with the straightness except right in front of the fin where I wasn't able to re-place the tabs. Since they're so close to the aft end of the stringer which is set centered by the fin they aren't too bad (about 0.125" off center at the worst point which is at the position of the aftmost right tab).

Tabs were clamped to the fuselage tubs with spring clamps and stringer was held centered my masking tape from the side fuselage tubes. After everything was in place I went back and cleaned up the methacrylate where possible with denatured alcohol.
