Removed the previously loosely installed set of pulleys under the rear passenger area and ran both elevator cables through -- the front cable goes on the right pulley, the rear cable on the left. Lithium greased and installed the bolt that acts as the pulley shaft. Spent quite a while filing cutout in the floorboard where the rear elevate cable passes through from the torque tube to ensure sufficient clearance at all control position.

Took apart the pulley assembly near the rear of the fuselage, lithium greased the this bolt/pulleys, and reinstalled with both elevator cables.

Installed pins on both castle nuts.

Attached the ends of both cables to the ends of the torque tube and fixed both in place with cotter pins.

Temporarily attached the aft end of the rudder cables to the rudder horn and had fun manipulating the rudder pedals and watching the rudder move.

Applied a bead of silicone to each of the rudder cable fairleads to secure in place (and avoid rattling).
