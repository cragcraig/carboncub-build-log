## Torque tube

Sanding/filing the torque tube block wasn't sufficient to modify the angle enough without causing interference between the torque tube rivets and the floorboard, so used spare .015" thick sheet aluminum from leading edge skins to fabricate a shim. The shim was .015" in front and doubled over (.030") in the rear to create an appropriate angle. Bolt holes were then match drilled through the shim so it could be installed under the torque tube block.

I then lightly sanded the torque tube at both ends where it fits in a torque tube block, starting with 150 grit, then 300 grit, then using a polishing pad with polishing compound.

I then torqued the tube blocks down with the bottom stiffener in place to 90 in-lb and the torque tube was able to rotate smoothly with the back sitting in place on the bottom half of the rear torque tube block.

At this point I applied green loctite to the rear end of the torque tube and installed the rear mast, pulling the 4 cherrymax rivets.

## Cover plate

Put pulley hardware in place, drilled cover plate pilot holes into floorboard, and installed cover plate. Castle nut left without pin because it will need to be removed to install control cables later.

## Control stick stubs

Installed the control stick stubs, greating with lithium grease and torquing the castle nut so that the stubs don't have any loose side-to-side movement but are still able to rotate forward and back freely.

## Rudder/brake pedal install

Applied two pieces of double stick tape to the rear outboard corner of the heel plates, clekoed them to the floorboard, and marked and trimmed the corner of the plates to match the floorboard.

Clekoed front rudder pedals in place through pre-drilled holes in floorboard and match drilled holes through rudder pedal base and heel plates to floorboard. Needed to drill through the heat duct bottom plate in two places using match drill jig.

Attached rear rudder pedals in place through pre-drilled hole and aligned with front rudder pedals as much as possible by measuring distance from front pedal edge using tape measure. Match drilled center rear screw holes on each pedal to fix position.

Used zip tie to attach master brake cylinder inlet/outlet on each pedal.

## Attach floorboard to fuselage

Moved floorboard into place in the fuselage and started loosely installing floorboard screws and bolts as appropriate, using 10-32 tap as necessary to clear out pre-drilled holes in fuselage and slighly enlarge pre-drilled holes in floorboard where necessary to align with fuselage holes.

Unfortunately it seems that when the floorboard is tightened down the angle between the front and rear torque tube blocks changes enough that the previously shimmed angle no longer is good enough and the torque tube does not rotate freely. Will need to remove the shim and adjust to get the angle right with the floorboard in place.
