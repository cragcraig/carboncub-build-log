First, trimmed the cabin heat shield bottom flush with the front of the floorboard.

Drilled floorboard pilot hole for front torque tube block with 1/4" bit. Ensured placement of block with stiffener and match drilled the second hole from the block to the floorboard.

Used dremel to sand out the top of the front and rear holes in the seat base for the torque tube to ensure >= 1/8" clearance.

Used stiffener as a template to match drill two holes in the front of the seat base.

Torqued the stiffener to the seat base screws with 40 in-lb.

Based on forum posts and video from Dave Embry, attempted to fix tight fit of torque tube in blocks by sanding/filing down the front bottom of the delrin torque tube block to fix the angle of the blocks.
