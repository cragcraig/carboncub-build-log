* Match drilled #30 holes from inside half-rib to front and rear spars.
* Pulled 8 x SS42 rivets attaching center rib to spars using modified marson hand-puller.

Ended up having to drill out and redo inside bottom rivet on front spar at least 5 times. I think the inside half-rib was slightly shorter than the outside half-rib and that introduced a gap between the rib sheet metal and the spar surface that caused the rivet pulls to fail, even when attempting to push it flat. Ultimately used a welding clamp to hold the sheet metal fully flat against the spar while pulling the rivet.

Verified that this rivet hole was still within allowable range for SS42 before the final good pull (ended up at ~0.132" vs max recommended hole size of 0.133").
