* Clamped aileron pulley bracket in place on front spar 4 5/8" from #8 rib, aligned flush with edge of spar cap.
* Match drilled and deburred 5 x #30 holes into spar cap.
* Pulled cherrymax rivets -- 4 pulled cleanly but the rivet in the center hole did not fully pull.

Due to the placement of the pre-drilled holes in the bracket, the tails of the cherrymax rivets all bottom on the spar bulb so are not able to be fully inserted before pulling. This requires a few small hand pulls with the G27 whith downward pressure on the head to fully seat the rivets.

Zach and I are not sure why the 1 rivet failed to pull. However, we've had 1 fail on each of his wings (though we have solid theories for why those failed) so we do have the dremel cutting jig that I fabricated for cutting off part of the tail under the spar cap. Unfortunately because the spar bulb is under the cherrymax tail, it is not possible to simply punch the steel stem out without damaging the spar bulb.

We were able to partially drill out the center stem using #45 and #55 bits, but after a while those stopped making progress and we were concerned about drifting too far off center and cutting into the edge of the rivet hole (because cherrymax rivets are aluminum around the steel stem).

It was getting late at this point so we decided to regroup and attack the rivet again another day.
