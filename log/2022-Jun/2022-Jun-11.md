## Fuel tank straps

* Installed strips of adhesive-backed felt cushioning centered horizontally on all fuel tank straps in areas where they will contact the fuel tank.

## Drag wires

* Drilled out holes in strut fitting blocks through spar webs for drag wires to 3/16".
* Enlarged 4 holes for the two larger drag wires with #9 drill bit.
* Installed drag wires and loosely tightened double nuts on each side in preparation for trammeling.
* Trimmed hole in #8 center rib to create clearance for drag wire (used hand nibbler, round files, and dremel with small sanding drum); tightened the wire and verified >1/8" clearance in all dimensions.
