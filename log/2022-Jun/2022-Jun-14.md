Began trammeling with the first bay with Zach's help.

Made numerous attempts at getting the #2 drag tube square to both the front and rear spar. Puzzeling through each attempt helped expand our understand the physics involved in trammeling this system.

Procedure for trammeling 1st bay:

* Start with 1st bay
* Fix string over rear spar at root and #4 drag tube
* Make sure drag wires in all other bays are loose with lots of slack (nuts ~1" away from fittings)
* Tighten 1st bay drag wires to achieve drag tube square to both sparts while keeping the rear spar straight (by manually adjusting the spars relative to each other)
* Get the force measured when deflecting the center of the thinner drag wire off straight by 0.5" to be 13-15 lbs.

Now this has the 1st bay with spars both straight and square to the drag tube (which aligns the ends for connecting to the fuselage later).

Next, work off this straight/square #1 bay to establish a straight #2 bay. Then repeat for the #3 bay, and so on down to the end of the wing.

Procedure for trammeling additional bays:

* Fix string over rear spar at root and at end of bay being trammeled
* Bring the nuts on each drag wire to finger tight
* Tighten nuts on both drag wires in tandem and by ~same distance, adjusting nuts asymmetrically as needed to make spar straight.
* Stop once the drag wire tension check is within 13-15 lbs.

However, we were having trouble getting the #1 bay both straight and square. We got the spar straight and the front spar square, but could not get the aft spar square to the drag tube. The measurements we were getting didn't seem possible based on simple parallel line geometry, which eventually led us to realize that the drag tube is just slightly short which causes the aft spar to pull in slightly right where the tube fitting attaches (because the drag wire tension pulls the spar in against the end of the tube). We confirmed this by placing a straightedge against the spar and observed an ~1/64" gap at the location of the #1 drag tube fitting on the aft spar (but not on the front spar, which makes sense since it is larger/stiffer). This introduced a slight angle to the rear spar locally next to the drag tube fitting, which is the surface where we used the square to check the angle to the drag tube.

This very slight behnd should not cause any issues (the straightness of the aft spar itself is easily within allowable tolerances, it just throws off our ability to check square). We were able to verify that the front spar was square to the drag tube and that the rear spar is straight. We will verify that the front spar is straight after trammeling the whole wing, but believe it is straight and parallel to the aft spar. This geometry implies that the rear spar is in fact square to the aft spar, but I wanted to directly verify that the drag tube was square to the rear spar as it is important to ensure the wing will assemble properly to the fuselage. Using a multi-plane laser level I was able to verify that the drag tube is in fact square to the aft spar.

Once the first spar was set, we used the procedure described above to trammel the 2nd bay. At this point it was late so we called it for the night as I was supposed to fly the Citabria with Lonnie the next morning at 8am (unfortunately ended up scrubbing due to very gusty winds).
