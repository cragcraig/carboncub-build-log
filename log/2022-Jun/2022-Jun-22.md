Trammeled 3rd and 4th bays.

Procedure:
* Loosen both drag wires to as much as 1" slack between nut and fitting
* Manually move rear spar into straight position
* Finger tighten nuts just enough to hold spar in this position
* Tighten both drag wires by turning nut on each wire by idential amounts at the ~same time
* Confirm spar is still straight
* Check drag wire tension, if not 13-15 lbs for 0.5" deflection at center of wire then continue tightening nuts in tandem

Rear spar looks very straight after trammeling. Slight inward bow at missing #2 rib location, as expected.
