1. Roughed surfaces in heat duct area on bottom of floorboard and top of heat shield using 80 grit emory cloth and wiped clean with denatured alcohol.
1. Cut pieces of adhesive roll of alumanized fiberglass heat shielding/insulation to fit hit duct area and applied to heat duct and heat shield piece to fully cover the internal surface of the duct, leaving a margin around the insulation to methacrylate the pieces together. Ended up using 3 separate overlapping cuts to do the bottom of the floorboard due to it being a very deep concave surface that the flat shielding does not easily conform over.
1. Cut out floorboard duct holes ni the shielding using exacto knife and trimmed with very small pair of scissors.
1. Applied bead of methacrylate around the edge of the insulation and sandwiched the shield and floorboard together. Used 2.5lb and 5lb weight plates and some clamps to hold the shield down and in place while the methacrylate set.
